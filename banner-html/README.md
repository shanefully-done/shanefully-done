# JavaScript Typewriter and Particles.js

This demonstrates the use of [Typewriter.js](https://github.com/tameemsafi/typewriterjs) and [Particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js) to create a dynamic banner. Typewriter.js is used to create animated text effects, while Particles.js is used to add interactive particle effects as a background.
